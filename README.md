# Rusty

This gem replaces many keywords with more-or-less equivalent method calls.

## Why?

I made a joke about Rust's proposed ["dot keyword" syntax](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/await-decision/), namely that they should apply it to all their keywords.

Then I took that joke too far.

I have nothing but respect for the Rust Lang Team's work, and their proposal regarding the `await` keyword makes perfect sense to me. This is just a well-intentioned goof.

## Usage

Don't?
