# Rusty

This gem replaces many keywords with more-or-less equivalent method calls.

## Why?

I made a joke about Rust's proposed ["dot keyword" syntax](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/await-decision/), namely that they should apply it to all their keywords.

Then I took that joke too far.

I have nothing but respect for the Rust Lang Team's work, and their proposal regarding the `await` keyword makes perfect sense to me. This is just a well-intentioned goof.

## Usage

Don't?

## Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank:

* John Mair, whose [binding_of_caller gem](https://github.com/banister/binding_of_caller), released under the MIT license, makes all this possible.
* The Rust Lang Team, who do great work and inspire terrible jokes.
* Matz, who will hopefully not ban me from using Ruby for releasing this.
